|tool|
==================================

|tool| is a visualization tool developed for human pangenomic research. Its primary function is to offer visual representations of large graph genomes,  facilitating the exploration and analysis of complex genomic data.
 

Motivation
---------------

Visualization is a fundamental aspect of genomics research, enabling researchers to interpret and analyze data that is typically formatted for efficient computation and storage. A visual interface for navigating large, complex datasets is crucial for detecting patterns and gaining meaningful insights.

Pangenomes often rely on a graph-based data structure
