|tool|
==================================

|tool| is a visualization tool developed for human pangenomic research. Its primary function is to offer visual representations of large graph genomes,  facilitating the exploration and analysis of complex genomic data.
 

Motivation
---------------

A visual interface is fundamental for detecting patterns and gaining meaningful insights into large, complex genomic datasets.
Pangenomes typically rely on a graph-based data structure, which are very difficult to navigate without a visualization of the graph topology.

   Physical locations have a hierarchical relationship. The level of detail needed depends on the goal.
