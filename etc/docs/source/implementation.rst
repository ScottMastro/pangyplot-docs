Implementation
==================================


Back-end: BubbleGun
------------------------------

`BubbleGun ðŸ”— <https://github.com/fawaz-dabbaghieh/bubble_gun>`_ is a tool that identifies topological structures in a GFA file.

``Superbubble`` - a acyclic, directed subgraph where nodes *s* and *t* are the source and sink nodes, respectively.
All paths that start at *s* end up at *t*.


``Bubble`` - a specific type of superbubble where *s* only has two outgoing edges and *t* has two incoming edges. 
Ex. a simple bialleleic SNP or indel.


``BubbleChain`` - a subgraph containing one or more bubbles such that the sink node of one bubble is the soruce node of the next.

A BubbleChain contains Bubbles. A BubbleChain can also be a part of a larger SuperBubble, which in turn can be inside an even larger SuperBubble or BubbleChain.
This nested structure is computed by BubbleGun.

Back-end: Neo4j
------------------------------

`Neo4j ðŸ”— <neo4jurl>`_ is a graph database where data is stored as a series of Nodes and Relationships.
Neo4j mirrors the stucture of the graph genomes which makes it ideal for storage and queries.

During setup of |tool|, an rGFA file is parsed and the S,L,P,W lines are extracted.
The S (segment) lines are added to the Neo4j database as nodes with properties that include 
-length
-chrom
-start
-end
-x,y coordinates

The L (link) lines are added as ``LINKS_TO`` relationships between two Segment nodes.

Front-end: D3 Force Graph
------------------------------

|tool| uses the `D3 Force Graph library ðŸ”— <https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph>`_ to draw the graph representation.

This library is able to render the graph given a set of nodes and links.
In |tool|, segments of sequence are represented by nodes. 
These segments can have variable length and it was important to capture the length information in the rendering of the graph.
|tool| splits up longer segments into a series of connected D3 nodes, using thickly drawn links to give the illusion of length.

   How the stylized segments appear (top) versus how they structured from the perspective of the D3 engine (bottom).

For example, Segments 426 and 427 above represent a SNP, and are drawn with a single D3 node.
In contrast, Segment 428 is 932 base pairs long and is drawn with 9 nodes, internally named 428#0 through 428#8.
